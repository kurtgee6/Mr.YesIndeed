            Woodrow was a college professor at Cleveland Community College and Martha was an administrator for Shelby Public Schools.
            Curtis grew up in Shelby, North Carolina.  
            His family name became known for it’s Martial Arts background. The whole family (Woodrow, Martha, Jaron, and Curtis) 
            were black belts and skilled in the Japanese form of Shi Toh Ryu and taught as a family.  
            Curtis quickly gained fame as he began to sweep throughout Cleveland County winning numerous karate tournaments.  
            In his teenage years, Curtis began using his skills for fight choreography for several events including the theatrical play THE WIZ.  
            Those years became sweeter when he fell in love with a young lady name Demeca W. Brewer.  Both were accepted at UNC Chapel Hill.  
            Curtis and Demeca moved to Chapel Hill, NC.  Later, this couple became Curtis and Demeca Glenn.  
            As the years past, they had two daughters (Kipany Glenn, Bahtia Glenn).  Not only did Curtis and Demeca teach karate, but also dance.  
            As a couple (and family) the Glenn traditions were carried out as in the former time in Shelby.
